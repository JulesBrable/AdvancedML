# AdvancedML
Repository for the final project of the Advanced Machine Learning course (taught by Austin Stromme during the 1st Semester of the final year at ENSAE Paris).

## Contents

* `notebooks` folder contains the notebook `descriptives.ipynb`, which briefly shows how to reproduce the empirical results we obtained in our paper (the underlying approach followed in this notebooks is described in our paper). This notebook contains 3 sections : Data, K-Fold Cross Validation and Training with best hyper-paramters.
* `src` folder contains the 2 modules (`etl` and `model`) we are using in the notebook `descriptives.ipynb`. Basically, the scripts inside these modules allow to extract and preprocessed data, as well as build, training and evaluating the models we are using.
* `app` folder contains the source code of a [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) web app (see below for a more detailed description of this app).

_**Note:** this repository does not contains the final report associated to this study (in which we present more in depth both theoritical and empirical aspectsof our work)._

## Setup Instructions

From the command line, you will have to follow the following steps to set this project up:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulesBrable/AdvancedML.git
```

2. Go to the project folder:
```bash
cd AvdancedML
```

3. Install the listed dependencies:
   
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the project as a package:
   
```bash
pip install -e .
```

5. Get the data:

```python
python src/etl/utils.py
```

_**Note:** the data comes from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition), and can also be directly downloaded from this site._

## Web application

In this project, we also built a simple [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) web app. Its purpose it to visualize intuitively how the Adam algorithm is performing on minimizing a mathematical function. The user is encouraged to test different combination of Adam's hyper-paramters, to see their impact on the optimization path.

To access the app, one can simply click [here](https://advancedml-optimization.streamlit.app/) (it is deployed on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)). You just have to authenticate yourself before (creating a Streamlit account is completely free of charge).

On the other hand, you can also run this app locally. To do so, once you have followed the set-up instruction described above, you will have to run the following commands:

1. Go to the app folder:

```bash
cd app
```

2. Run this app locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port=8000
```

By default, we are using port 8000, so once you have run the last two commands, you will be able to access the app with the following link: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
